// Java Program to Find the Perimeter of a Rectangle

/* 
A Rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles (90Â°). In a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal. A rectangle with all four sides equal is called a Square. A rectangle can also be called as right angled parallelogram.
 * 
 * the sides A and C are equal and B and D are equal.

    The perimeter of a rectangle is the total length of all its four sides. It can be simply calculated by all its four sides.

    Perimeter of rectangle ABCD = A+B+C+D
 * 
 * Since the opposite sides are equal in a rectangle, it can be calculated as the sum of twice of one of its side and twice of its adjacent side.
 * 
 * Perimeter of rectangle ABCD = 2A + 2B = 2(A+B)
 *
