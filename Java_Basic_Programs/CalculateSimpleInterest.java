/*Java Program to Calculate Simple Interest

Simple interest is a quick method of calculating the interest charge on a loan. Simple interest is determined by multiplying the daily interest rate by the principal by the number of days that elapse between payments. 

Simple interest formula is given by:

    Simple Interest = (P x T x R)/100

Where, 

    P is the principal amount 
    T is the time and 
    R is the rate


Examples: â€“

Example 1:

    Input :  P = 10000
            R = 5
            T = 5
    Output : 2500

    Explanation - We need to find simple interest on 
    Rs. 10, 000 at the rate of 5% for 5 
    units of time.

    Example 2:

    Input :  P = 3000
            R = 7
            T = 1
    Output : 210

    // We can change values here for
    // different inputs
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        float P = 10000, R = 5, T = 5;

        /* Calculate simple interest */
        float SI = (P * T * R) / 100;
        System.out.println("Simple interest = " + SI);
